# CXO_and_GOES_analyses

Python code mapping and analysing Jupiter's X-ray emissions using Chandra HRC-I observations. The mapping algorithm is adapted from https://github.com/waledeigt/zeno-py and contains some minor changes regarding the selection process of jovian photons. 

Also contained is a new PI filtering method of our data which aims to account for gain degradation in HRC-I over time.

Our temporal analyses involved making comparisons between the jovian disk light curve and the corresponing GOES solar X-ray flux light curve. We also introduce Voronoi tessellation diagrams for our spatial analyses to explore the possibility of another driver of this emission. 

Aims to be a public platform to share code/data/etc easily.
